                <p class="text">I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA and have lived there my entire 
                    life. My interest in computers and technology was founded quite early in 
                    my childhood through my constant interaction with them. It was only when I 
                    arrived in high school that I realized that the world of computers was infinitely 
                    larger than I could have ever imagined, and that is what began my search to educate
                    myself on computers as much as I could.</p>

                <p class="text">A large majority of my hobbies are related to technology and/or computers, and so one
                    of my favorite hobbies is gaming. I have been playing video games for as long as I can
                    remember and have always enjoyed them.

                <p class="text">I find a lot of satisfaction in having a thought or idea in my head and successfully
                    bringing it to fruition as a physical thing. Blending my love for computers with that
                    satisfying process brought me to where I am now.</p>
